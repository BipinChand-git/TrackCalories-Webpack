# TrackCalories-Webpack

This project is a refactored version of the original TrackCalories project, now using Webpack for bundling and breaking down the JavaScript file into modules for better organization and maintainability. The project has also been deployed to Netlify.

## Overview

The TrackCalories-Webpack project helps you track your daily calorie intake, manage your meals, and visualize your progress. By utilizing Webpack and modular JavaScript, the project is more efficient, well-organized, and easier to maintain.

## Benefits of Using Webpack and Modules

- **Modularity**: Breaking down JavaScript files into smaller modules makes it easier to manage and maintain code.
- **Bundling**: Webpack bundles all your JavaScript files into a single file, reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving page load speed.
- **Code Splitting**: Webpack allows for code splitting, which means you can load only the necessary code for each page or feature, improving performance.
- **Hot Module Replacement**: During development, Webpack can automatically update the modules in the browser without requiring a full refresh.
- **Tree Shaking**: Webpack can remove unused code, reducing the final bundle size and improving performance.
